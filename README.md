# django-formClass-cw

Start from stratch for this one.

Create a model and form for an Employee Application. Give it a name, date of birth, position applying to, and salary. On the home page (index), list all employee names and the position they are applying to next to it. Underneath that in large letters post "Apply Here" with a form for people to apply underneath that. Once the person hits submit, it should add the employee to the database and update the homepage to show the new entry. All of this should be on one page.
